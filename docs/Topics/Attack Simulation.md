## Attack Simulation
In this systems created for an ethical hacking course would be used to simulate and demonstrate a specific APT and their TTPs to conduct an attack on the virtualized targets. The idea is to conduct an attack and analyze it.

### Why?
This simulation would allow for the observation of traffic and system changes to show the effects of an attack within an enterprise environment. Attack simulation allows security professionals to analyze APTs within a secure environment which can help lead to the development of better security tools, hunting techniques, and a better understanding of how a threat actor thinks and acts. I personally am interested in this topic because in a previous class for a project, we did the same thing at a smaller scale, I would like to be able to expand on that making it bigger and more in-depth.

This project would allow me to further my skills as a threat hunter/researcher by allowing me to fully dive into a specific threat actor.
  
### Features/Objectives
- Main Priority:
   - Creation of tragets to be used
   - making sure they are attackable
   - they are easy to reset
   - the setup could be automated (requires learning ansible) 
- Expansion of project:
   -  logging
   -  security features
      - Wazuh
      - Elastic
      - Security Onion 
   -  Simulate an attack based on a specific APT by using their TTPs as well as the deployment of:
   -  malware
   -  backdoors
   -  any other malicious processes/programs
