# Eth-Hack Lab Creation
This project is to create targets for eth-hack II students to take on and are going to be used within those classes. 

## Why
This provides further learning opportunities for myself as I have not created vulnerable targets before as well as providing challenges for furture eth-hack students.

## Features/Objectives
Main Priority:
- Creation of tragets to be used
- making sure they are attackable
- they are easy to reset
- the setup could be automated (requires learning ansible)
