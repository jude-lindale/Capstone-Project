Topic Ideas
## Attack Simulation
Is a simulation using specific APTs TTPs to conduct an attack within a virtual environment. The idea is to conduct an attack and analyze it.

### Why?
This simulation would allow for the observation of traffic and system changes to show the effects of an attack within an enterprise environment. Attack simulation allows security professionals to analyze APTs within a secure environment which can help lead to the development of better security tools, hunting techniques, and a better understanding of how a threat actor thinks and acts. I personally am interested in this topic because in a previous class for a project, we did the same thing at a smaller scale, I would like to be able to expand on that making it bigger and more in-depth.

This project would allow me to further my skills as a threat hunter/researcher by allowing me to fully dive into a specific threat actor.
  
### Features/Objectives
- have a virtual enterprise environment with:
   -  logging
   -  security features
      - EDR
      - SEIM  
   -  Simulate an attack based on a specific APT by using their TTPs as well as the deployment of:
   -  malware
   -  backdoors
   -  any other malicious processes/programs

## Malware
For this a piece of either in-house, like a backdoor, or existing malware, like GhostRAT, would be taken and put into a legitimate program/process. 

### Why?  
This would demonstrate how seemingly normal processes can be used to conduct attacks or be used in a malicious manner through embedding malware or malicious code within a legitimate process. Taking a process and making it malicious allows for the identification of code that is not secure or the finding of areas within the code that could be strengthened to help deter attackers from using said process because it is harder to manipulate. 

 If we can identify where a process can be exploited then we can figure out a way to fix it.
 
This project will allow me to practice programming in a manner that I have never done before.

### Features/Objectives
- to manipulate a legitimate process
   - make it malicious
   - OR add malicious components within the process
